# IW Engine Font Gen
## Basically just a Dear ImGui demo application but exports the font.

The default charset here is Unicode which used by the Ghosts.
Older CoDs use different MBCS for different languages,

e.g.:
- Japanese: Shift-JIS
- Chinese: GBK

You may convert the output encoding yourself.

The export format is json not the binary format that you found in mod tool.
